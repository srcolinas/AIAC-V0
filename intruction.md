Implement the game described in the README.md file. The mechanics and rules of the game can be the same as Settlers of Catan, but you need to come up with original:

1. Artwork (board sesign, card illustrations, buildings, roads, etc.)
2. Text for the Rulebook
3. Names for buildings.
4. Logos and slogans

No references to the original Settlers of Catan should be included in the game. 

Make any research needed to make sure the game represents the economics and ways of building of the Tayrona people. 

Do not override the desc.md or the instruction.md files, but create a full README.md on your own.
